Jeremys comments:
  Great title

  Nobody calls it a reef knot. (consider using "square knot")
  Consider changing to overhand knot or overhand stopper knot
  Regarding capsizing: "opposite of the way you pull it to tie it"
  "opens the knot"
  Suggests an animation for capsizing
  Reference army book for square knot on shoes
  What, no bows?
