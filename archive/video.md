Why are shoelaces so long anyway?

I don't know, but I DO know that with long shoelaces, you have to tie them in a BOW to
keep the lace off the ground.

And those bows catch on things when I walk around, and the laces come untied.
And then I'm tying my shoes again. And again. And again.

This is Madness!

What if you didn't have long laces in the first place?
What if you didn't have to tie them in a bow?

I'm here to show you that with short laces and no bows, life gets a lot simpler.

    1. Mark your laces at ground level. This is plenty of lace to get your shoe in and out.
       get it on and off.

    2. Tie an figure eight knot just past the mark. This keeps your shoelace from unraveling, and keeps the knot from passing through the eyelet.

    3. Cut off the extra.

    4. Tie with a square knot / Untie by capsizing

There you have it! That's how to be sane in the world of shoelaces---with short laces
and no bows!

The beauty of this is that if you put your shoe on just to walk out to the garden, and you don't want ot bother tying them at all---you don't have to. They still won't drag on the ground
