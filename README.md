Shoelaces

Why are shoelaces so long anyway?

I don't know, but I DO know that with long shoelaces, you have to tie them in a BOW to
keep the lace off the ground.

And those bows catch on things when I walk around, and the laces come untied.

And then I'm tying my shoes again. And again. And again.

This is Madness!

What if you didn't have to have long laces in the first place?  What if you didn't have to tie them in a
bow?

YOU DON'T!!

I'm going to show you how to shorten your laces so you only have to tie them once (or
sometimes not at all) when you put your shoe on.

Steps:

    1. Figure out how much lace you need.  You only need anough to loosen your shoe to
       get it on and off.

    2. Tie a stopper knot  (like a figure eight) to mark how much lace you need.

    3. Discard the extra

    4. Tie a square knot (a.k.a. reef knot) --- no loops!

    5. To untie them, pull sideways on the knot to capsize it

And the added bonus is now your laces are so short, if you don't want to tie them, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO! and your laces still won't touch the ground! Your shoes now double as slippers!

There you have it! That's how to be sane in the world of shoelaces---with short laces
and no bows!
